# Heart Disease Prediction â€“ Machine Learning Pipeline

This project implements a **comprehensive machine learning pipeline** .  
It includes data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- **data/**  
  Contains the dataset (`heart_disease.csv`).

- **notebooks/**  
  python codes for each stage of the pipeline (visual studio code) :  
  1. `Data_PreProcessing.py`  
  2. `PCA_analysis.py`  
  3. `Feature_Selection.py`  
  4. `Supervised_Learning.py`  
  5. `UnSupervised_Learning.py`  
  6. `Hyperparameter_tuning.py`

- **models/**  
  Trained models stored as pickle files (e.g., `final_model.pkl`).

- **results/**  
  Evaluation metrics (`evaluation_metrics.txt`).

- **requirements.txt**  
  Python dependencies.
